# 💫 About Me:
**Hi there 🙌**

I'm *leap*, a frontend designer based in Cambodia.
I love turning design ideas into lightning-fast, accessible interfaces that feel effortless.

Outside of code and Figma design, I'm also a backend person who continues learning about business logic and solves real-world problems.

## Fun Facts: 
  - I love hot coffee and tea.
  - Country side is my favorite place.
